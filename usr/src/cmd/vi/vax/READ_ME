    This is version 3 of the editor. It is too large to fit on a pdp-11
unless you have overlay code. (Such code is available for v7 unix on
2bsd (Berkeley) and UNIX 4.0.).  Version 2.15 corresponds to version 3.7
without the enhancements in 3.7.  There is no reason to use 2.15 unless
you have a pdp-11 that does not have overlay software, since 3 contains
all the bug fixes and some new features.

Special installation notes for this version.

Conditional compilation flags:
	-DTRACE		for debugging (wont then fit on an 11)
	-DVFORK		for UCB Vax/Unix with the vfork system call.
	-DCHDIR		compile in undocumented old chdir (cd) command
	-DLISP		compile in lisp hacks
	-DUCVISUAL	compile in code to handle \ escapes for visual
		       on upper case only terminals.  gross.

Ex means to avoid stdio like the plague. If any of stdio other than the
ctype.h functions or str* get pulled in, it is a mistake.

Ex is very large, but it (2.15) should fit (barely) on an 11/70. 
There are only a few bytes of room left in version 2.15 unless you
take out some of CHDIR, LISP, or UCVISUAL. This assumes the new
termlib (which knows about the tc= capability, 1024 byte entries,
and @ cancellation of capabilities); and that -t1 is NOT used
for compilation.
