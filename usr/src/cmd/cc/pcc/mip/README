The files in this directory are used by lint(1) and cflow(1).
They are not used by the Software Generation System's C compiler
family for the M68000 (cc, ccom, optim).  Their origin is the
VAX C compiler's source (pcc).  We have been unable to determine
corresponding source under pcc2 (68000 C compiler).
