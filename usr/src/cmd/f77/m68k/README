/*	@(#)README	2.1		*/
The f77 compiler for the 5.0 UNIX release can be built in two ways.
The makefile "f77.mk" makes the traditional 2-pass version which is
recommended for swapped systems.
The makefile "f771p.mk" makes the new 1-pass version, suitable for
paged systems or ones in which one can afford to run f77 pretty much
by itself with no other large jobs.
For the first time, f77 is tagging along the f* files from pcc since
they are fortran specific and the 1-pass version grabs pcc stuff itself.
