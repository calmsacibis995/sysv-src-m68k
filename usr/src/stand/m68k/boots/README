	To install the two bootloader modules into a new 1024 byte block 
	file system (bootable 512 byte systems are not supported),
	execute:
		make -f boots.mk UDDEV=special udinstall
	where "special" is the raw disk device to be made bootable.
	The CMD based root file system is bootable as distributed
	and is expected to reside on special device /dev/rdk00 or /dev/rdk10.
